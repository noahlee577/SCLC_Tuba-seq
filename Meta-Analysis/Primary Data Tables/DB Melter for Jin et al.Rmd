Though used to reshape dataset in Jin et al. 2021 article, this code should generally work for any dataframe that's in the long form 



```{r import and reshape dataset }

df <- read.xlsx("Jin et al 2021 BioMed Research International.xlsx")

df2 <- dcast(df, Gene~Mutation_Type, length)

write.xlsx(df2, "Jin et al 2021 BioMed Research International Parsed.xlsx")


```
