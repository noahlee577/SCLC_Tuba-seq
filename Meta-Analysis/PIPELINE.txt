1. Add manual edits to SCLC Mutation Summary for Merge.xlsx
2. Run Database Builder.Rmd to add things from Primary Tables Notated for Concat
3. Create SCLC Mutation Summary All.xls by using the Merge.xlsx result (copy/paste) - Remember to copy over extra gene names too from Merge.xlsx that aren't found in Summary All.xlsx and update # studies field
4. Run SCLC_alteration_counter.py
5. Copy over the # Patients.. etc columns from _counted file onto ...Summary All.xlsx and re-write over _counted.xlsx
5. Grab all gene lists from SCLC Mutation All_counted.xlsx and query on UniProt DB (use GeneCards -> UniProt KB)
6. Download the table into Primary Data Tables/UniProt on SCLC_All.xlsx (Excel, uncompressed)
7. Run UniProt Concater.Rmd (If table isn't loading properly, shorten the first cell ("yourlist~~~" to "yourlist")
8. Paste last two columns of Merged_Prot.xlsx to your SCLC Mutation All_counted.xlsx
9. Might need to manually go through ones with multiple notations (e.g. HIST1H2A stuff) -> I have merged the data for genes in question when it made more sense to do so
10. Run Expression_Merge.Rmd
11. Paste over appropriate columns from Merged_Expression.xlsx to your All_counted_prot etc
12. Run Depmap_Append.Rmd (select CRISPR or RNAi if you want, default CRISPR) 
13. Paste over appropriate columns from Merged_Dependency.xlsx to your All_counted_prot
